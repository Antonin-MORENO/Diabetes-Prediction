    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes is a serious chronic disease affecting millions of people worldwide. It's a metabolic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels. Untreated diabetes can lead to severe complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, blindness, and limb amputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early prevention and management of diabetes are crucial for reducing the risk of complications. Identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes is a vital step in preventing the disease. Machine learning can be a powerful tool for predicting an individual's risk of diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes in an individual using a dataset of patients with and without diabetes. The model will be built using machine learning techniques like logistic regression or random forests. The model will then be evaluated on its ability to accurately predict diabetes in new patients."

    "# About dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "In our dataset we have 8 features which are medical and demographic data from patiens and 1 output which is their diabetes status. Let's define all the features:\n",
    "- **Gender** : It's a categorical feature which refer to the biological sex of the person which can have an impact on their suceptibility to diabetes \n",
    "- **Age** : It's a numerical feature which refer to the patient's age. It's an important factor as diabetes is more commonly diagnosed in older alduts.\n",
    "- **Hypertension** : It's a categorical feature which refer to medical condtion in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.\n",
    "- **Heart disease** : It's a catgorical feature which refer to the presence of an another hmedical condition associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes\n",
    "- **Smoking history** : It's a categorical feature which refer to the patient's smoking condition it can be *\"not current\"*, *\"former\"*, *\"No Info\"*, *\"current\"*, *\"never\"* and *\"ever\"*\n",
    "- **bmi** : It's a numerical feature which refer to the patient's body mass index\n",
    "- **HbA1c level** : It's a numerical feature which refer to the patient's HbA1x level, which is a measure of a person's average blood sugar level over the past 2 to 3 months.\n",
    "- **Blood glucose level** : It's a numerical feature which refer to the patient's blood glucose level.\n",
    "- **Diabetes** : It's the output (the value we want to predict), it's a categorical feature which refer to the presence of the diabetes in a patient."
